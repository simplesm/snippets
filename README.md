# snippets
snippets is an app which bundles frequently used UI5 patterns at one place. 

snippets is not intended to be a UI5 tutorial. There are tons of tutorials in the internet and I strongly recommend to read the [Developer Guide](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#docs/guide/Documentation.html) and go through the [SAP's UI5 API reference](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#docs/api/symbols/sap.ui.html) as a starting point. 

snippets can be considered as a toolbox which provides the right pattern for various requirements. Quicklinks direct you to working samples and the corresponding snippets. Select the required sample and copy the source code to your clipboard.

snippets can be downloaded in the Apple App Store for free.
