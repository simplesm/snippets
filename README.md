# snippets
snippets is an app which bundles all frequently used UI5 patterns at one place. 

snippets is not intended to be a be a UI5 tutorial. There a tons of tutorials that can be found in the internet and I strongly recommend to read the [Developer Guide](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#docs/guide/Documentation.html) and go through the [SAP's UI5 API reference](https://openui5.hana.ondemand.com/#docs/api/symbols/sap.ui.html) as a starting point. It can be considered as a toolbox wich provides for any situation the right pattern. 

Each snippet consists of a working example and the corresponding snippet. So in order to see how it works you can browse the example code and copy it into your device's clipboard for further processing.

It can be downloaded in the Apple App Store for free.
